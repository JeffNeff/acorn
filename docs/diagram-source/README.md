### Instructions for this directory

We are creating our diagrams using [draw.io](https://draw.io). 

The source XML files for the diagrams are maintained in this directory. The corresponding image files are maintained in the `[Acorn Root]/docs/static/diagrams` directory.

To update a diagram, load its XML file into draw.io, make the necessary changes, download the updated XML, export a new image file, and commit both of those files to this repository.

Do not change either the XML or image file without updating the other as well.
